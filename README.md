# Total positivity and  accurate computations with Gram matrices of Bernstein bases 
In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of the Gram matrices of Bersntein bases of positive and negative degree are provided.

1. In [Collocation_matrix_Jacobi](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_JSC_2021/tree/main/Collocation_matrix_Jacobi) the bidiagonal decomposition of the collocation matrix of Jacobi basis is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 
2. In [Wronskian_matrix_Jacobi](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_JSC_2021/tree/main/Wronskian_matrix_Jacobi) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Wronskian matrix of Jacobi basis is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 

The implementation uses Matlab 2021b and Wolfram Mathematica.
